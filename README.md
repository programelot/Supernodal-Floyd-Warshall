# Supernodal-Floyd-Warshall

The Supernodal Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm that can solve all-pair-shortest-path in a sparse graph.\
I made this in 2020 the first semester of my graduate university project.\
The code was bit dirty so I cleaned it little bit at the end of 2023.\
For a traveler who travels the optimization field, I left this implementation in here.

# Notes
There could be a better implementation since I am not metis-friendly.\
I made some parts of the operation in my own way of estimation. (Finding nested Dissection)\
I will fix it when I can do it later.

# Original source
The original source I made in 2020 can be found in the archive branch.\
It also includes some documents that I used for the lecture.\
